# On-Chain-Splitwise
Simple contract that keeps tracks of who owes who in a friend group. This was a project for the Stanford class, CS251: Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies. 

mycontract.sol contains the simple Solidity contract I wrote to keep track of IOUs. Script.js interacts with the contract using the Web3 JS library functions. 
Finally, style.css and index.html provide a barebones frontend for the application. 

abi-decoder.js, web3.min.js, web3.min.js.map, util.js, style.css, index.html were all provided. I did not write them.
